## Development Notes

This changelog will be updated by agents as they implement tickets. Each ticket implementation should add an entry under the `[Unreleased]` section with the format:

- `[EP-X-TY] Brief description of what was implemented (vX.Y.Z)`

**Version Management:**
- Each major feature implementation should include a version number
- Version numbers follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- When releases are created, the `[Unreleased]` section will be moved to a version number (e.g., `[1.0.0]`)
